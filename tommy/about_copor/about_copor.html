Tommy Hilfiger is actively involved in supporting causes around the world. Listed below are a few of our key partnerships, initiatives and charitable activities:<br/><br/><br/><span class="mini_title">SAVE THE CHILDRENPVH</span><br/><br/><br/><br/>PVH has long supported the work of Save the Children and signed a five-year global partnership with the organization in 2014. Tommy Hilfiger works with Save the Children in Delhi, India to fight child labor in the garment industry, in addition to developing the quality of child protective services and supporting the admission of children in school systems. To date, over 1,000 children have enrolled in vocational training courses, schools, or learning centers we support. The program has also trained nearly 1,000 police officials on awareness of child labor in the garment industry, and over 3,000 people have received free medical check-ups within this program. In 2016, Save the Children and partner NGO, EFRAH reached out to 151 additional children through bridge course edu cation, totaling 1.344 children.<a href="#" class="care_site">www.savethechildren.net.</a><br/><br/>For more information on Save the Children, please visit <a href="#" class="care_site">www.savethechildren.net.</a></p>   
                        <p class="care_text care_text_2">The World Wide Fund (WWF) works to conserve representative species and the most critical ecosystems. It focuses on helping to reduce the impact of human activities by transforming the most significant market forces, institutions, policies, and conservation practices. WWF was the first environmental group invited by the Chinese government to work within the country, and WWF has a bold conservation vision to prtotect one of the world’s most important rivers; Yangtze. TommyCares supports WWF in protecting the Yangtze river in China through various projects that include expanding protected areas for endangered species, safeguarding the health of freshwater ecosystems, and engaging local stakeholders on managing and utilizing natural resources in a sustainable manner.<br/><br/>For more information on <span class="care_site">WWF</span>, please visit <a href="#" class="care_site">www.worldwildlife.org.</a><br/><br/><span class="mini_title">WAR CHILD</span><br/><br/><br/>War Child was founded in 1993 by filmmakers David Wilson and Bill Leeson. On assignment in the former-Yugoslavia during the Bosnian war, they were horrified by the violence and ethnic cleansing they witnessed, and its impact on children. Upon returning to the U.K. they were equally shocked to see the apathy and inaction of political leaders regarding the massacres on their European doorstep. War Child was born. Instead of relying on politicians, they looked to music and high-profile pop stars to help publicize the plight of children caught up in war. Their first War Child aid convoy delivered needed supplies to the besieged people of Mostar in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and set-up a mobile bakery that produced tens of thousands of bread loaves per day.<br/><br/> War Child’s projects have expanded to reach conflict zones across the world, wherever children are caught up in wars – whether they’ve lost their homes, families, schools, or been forced to take part in atrocities.<br/><br/>Since 2013, TommyCares supports War Child in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where children are extremely vulnerable and suffer from trauma due to armed conflicts. The supported project provides psychological support and improved access to quality education to 6.282 children and 109 adults from Kalehe community in the South Kiva region.For more information on War Child, please visit:<br/><a href="#" class="care_site">www.warchild.org.uk.</a><br/><br/><span class="mini_title">AUTISM SPEAKS</span><br/><br/><br/>Autism Speaks is one of the world’s leading autism science and advocacy organization, dedicated to researching causes, prevention, treatments and finding a cure for autism. It also raises public awareness about autism and its effects on individuals, families and society. Since 2010, the Tommy Hilfiger brand has supported World Autism Awareness Day with special programs in key stores across the country, including the annual “Light It Up Blue” fundraising campaign at its flagships on Fifth Avenue in New York City and Robertson Boulevard in L.A. The company sponsors additional events in North America through Autism Speaks each year. Additionally, Mr. Tommy Hilfiger and his wife Dee are both personally involved with the organization, and in 2012 they were appointed to the Autism Speaks Board of Directors.

                <p>Our sustainability journey is a continuous mission, and we receive many queries about how we approach and address our global sustainability programing. Below we provide answers to some of the most frequently asked questions; if you have a question that is not included below, please contact our Corporate Responsibility team at CR@tommy.com.<br/><br/><span class="faq_sub">How sustainable is Tommy Hilfiger?</span><br/>Our mission is to become one of the leading sustainable designer lifestyle brands by 2020, and we have created a broad program with ambitious goals across our global operations. Have a look at our three principles and 10 commitments to see what we are actively working on.<br/><br/><span class="faq_sub">What is the Sustainable Evolution program?</span><br/>The Sustainable Evolution program is our way of embedding sustainability into our day-to-day business. It consists of 10 commitments on how we can become more sustainable in the way we create our product, the way we operate and the way we connect to our stakeholders and communities around us. We named it our “Sustainable Evolution” because we realize change takes time, but we are determined to instill these changes in our brand DNA. It is an opportunity to collaborate with our key partners, drive positive change and at the same time make our business even stronger.<br/><br/><span class="faq_sub">What does Tommy Hilfiger do about the environmental impact of the product?</span><br/>Cotton is the fiber we use most in our collections, and as it has a substantial environmental impact, we are aiming to procure 100% of our cotton from more sustainable sources by 2020 (see <a href="#" class="faq_link">Commitment #1</a>). In 2013, we joined the <a href="#" class="faq_link">Better Cotton Initiative</a> and are rapidly increasing the amount of Better Cotton we source. Since 2012, we also have produced four million pieces in organic cotton and we continue to increasingly use organic cotton in our styles.<br/><br/>Water is an important resource in textile production and the fashion industry has a significant impact on water resources. Together with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) we have initiated a program to improve water stewardship in our supply chains (see Commitments #2 and #3).<br/><br/>While cotton and water are our main priorities, we are also focusing on other areas of our supply chain. Through our parent company PVH, we are rolling out a chemicals management program and we collaborate with peers within the <a href="#" class="faq_link">Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC)</a> organization. Tommy Hilfiger also became a member of the <a href="#" class="faq_link">Leather Working Group</a> and we seek to increase the use of more sustainable alternatives for other materials.<br/><br/><span class="faq_sub">How does Tommy Hilfiger manage its carbon footprint?</span><br/>We have already taken initiatives to decrease our footprint, such as switching to LED lighting in our stores and improving logistics. We are in the process of completing the measurement of our global footprint, so we can establish a broader and more comprehensive program to reduce our impact. See also <a href="#" class="faq_link">commitment #4.</a><br/><br/><span class="faq_sub">How does Tommy Hilfiger manage its supply chain?</span><br/>All of our vendors adhere to our Restricted Substances List (RSL) and chemicals testing program to ensure our products are free from harmful chemicals. All of our suppliers are monitored on the use of chemicals and are required to disclose their suppliers. This helps us establish a more rigorous chemicals management program that includes suppliers further up the supply chain, such as fabric mills. PVH Corp. is also a member of the ZDHC, where we work with other brands to phase harmful chemicals out of our supply chains.<br/><br/><span class="faq_sub">Where do you produce your products?</span><br/>Our products are produced all over the world, from Italy to Indonesia. Our largest production countries include China, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Turkey.<br/><br/><span class="faq_sub">How do you safeguard healthy and safe working conditions for workers in Bangladesh?</span><br/>PVH is one of the founding members of the <a href="#" class="faq_link">Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh</a>, in which we work with approximately 200 brands, owners and retailers on a common plan to improve safety for garment workers in Bangladesh. All Bangladeshi garment factories where PVH and other Accord members’ goods are produced have been inspected by a special task force and improvement plans are being made where necessary. We also have our own team of seven auditors who regularly visit and work with the factories on all different issues regarding workers’ rights.<br/><br/><span class="faq_sub">How does Tommy Hilfiger address animal welfare issues?</span><br/>Tommy Hilfiger does not endorse the use of real fur or angora in our collections and we are currently implementing sustainable down certifications into supply chain.We are committed to sourcing materials in a responsible and ethical manner in strict accordance with the Company’s Code of Conduct.<br/><br/>Are there corporate philanthropy projects at Tommy Hilfiger? How do you give back?<br/>Through our TommyCares program we support many organizations and we enable and encourage our employees to support local communities by volunteering. Click here to read more about TommyCares.<br/><br/><span class="faq_sub">How do you safeguard good working conditions in your factories?</span><br/>Upholding human rights in our supply chain has been extremely important to us for many years. PVH is a founding member of the Fair Labor Association (FLA) which assesses all of our factories for compliance with “A Shared Commitment,” our Code of Conduct that complies with FLA standards. The assessment serves to create action plans together with factories to improve conditions where necessary. Ourcurrent focus is to build out our program to support suppliers in making improvements. <a href="#" class="faq_link">Click here</a> to read more about Commitment #8.</p>
